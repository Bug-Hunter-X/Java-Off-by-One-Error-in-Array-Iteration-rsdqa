This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration and its solution.  The Bug.java file contains the erroneous code.  The BugSolution.java file provides the corrected code.  The error occurs because of an incorrect loop condition that leads to accessing an index beyond the array bounds resulting in an exception during runtime. This example highlights the importance of careful attention to loop indices when working with arrays.
